---|---|---|---|---|---
Angel ECM|3045|2.0|2|The Angel ECM Suite is an advanced version of the Guardian ECM Suite operating on a broader spectrum and greatly advances ECM technology on the battlefield. Development of the Angel began in the Draconis Combine shortly after the Battle of Luthien, but despite assistance from ComStar, cost overruns and internal problems within both powers kept it in its experimental stages for a long time and delayed its widespread deployment.|700000.0
Armor Ballistic Reinforced|3063|0.0|1|Ballistic-Reinforced Armor was developed by the Draconis Combine in 3131 as a response to autocannon and missile weapons. The armor is a combination of Hardened and Reactive Armor that reduce damage taken from ballistic and missile weapons. The armor is also known as "reinforced" armor, but many techs use the term "hardened light" to describe it. A thinner version of hardened armor is backed by cable mesh that warps and traps missile and ballistic ammunition.|1000000.0
Armor Duralast (QS)|3045|0.0|1|Need more protection for your mech, but can't afford those other armors? Buy Quicsell branded Duralast armor lining today. Cheap to buy, and fast to repair, our armor leaves you adequately protected.|299999.0

Armor Heat Dissipating|3123|0.0|1|Heat-Dissipating Armor is a derivative of the Fire-Resistant Armor used by Clan battlesuits. Created by the Capellan Confederation, it reduces the effects of fire and incendiary weapons on a BattleMech's heat exchange system while intact. Unlike some specialty armors, it is effective against most weapons, but the increased bulk of the armor (from additional insulation and modified sealants) results in less overall protection per ton.|572500.0
Armor NSS|3045|0.0|1|The Null Signature System is another Capelan endeavour to recreate lost Star League ECM. An upgraded Stealth Armour allows this to reduce incoming hits and trades heat generation for a reduced sensor and target signature. Reserves 1 slot in every Location except the Head and requires an ECM.|1200000.0

Battle Fist|3015|0.0|1|Hardened hand actuators.|400000.0
Black Carapace|3059|0.0|1|The Black Carapace is the result of a secret research project which integrated the HarJel self-repair system directly into the armor plates. As a result the armor is slightly more bulky and heavier but the self-repait effect makes more than up for this. However, due to the compact build weapon heat can be vented less effectively.|8500000.0
C.A.S.E. II (QS)|3045|0.8|1|'When you can't afford the best, make sure you try the rest!' Our C.A.S.E II is nearly as good as the real deal. It does exactly the same thing, other than a minor difference of how much damage sneaks past.|169999.0

Cooling Lines|3043|1.0|1|Cooling lines considerably improve the way heat is transported through the 'mech component using a complex multi-layer tubing system. This allows for a considerable uplift in heat sinking performance. Due to the complexity of the design cooling lines cannot be installed on the center torso to benefit engine heatsinks.|760000.0
Double Heat Sink (QS)|3045|1.0|2|Want to get some better heatsinks without breaking the bank? Try Quicsell brand Double Heatsinks today!

Prototype Heat Sink Kit|3055|0.0|1||3200000.0
Prototype Heat Sink|3055|1.0|1|These Prototype Double Heat Sinks were created by House Davion researchers. Unlike the Double Heat Sinks used by the Star League and after the War of 3039 these prototype units were smaller.

Structure Composite|3061|0.0|1|Inspired by the Endo Steel chassis, the FedSuns engineers produced a chassis that was light weight but wasn't as bulky as the Endo Steel skeleton.
