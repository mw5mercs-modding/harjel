Armor Ballistic Reinforced|3063|0.0|10|Ballistic-Reinforced Armor was developed by the Draconis Combine in 3131 as a response to autocannon and missile weapons. The armor is a combination of Hardened and Reactive Armor that reduce damage taken from ballistic and missile weapons. The armor is also known as "reinforced" armor, but many techs use the term "hardened light" to describe it. A thinner version of hardened armor is backed by cable mesh that warps and traps missile and ballistic ammunition.|1000000.0
Armor Spall Liner|3058|0.0|2|Spall Liner Armor reduces incoming damage at the cost of weight.|1000000.0
Black Carapace|3059|0.0|7|The Black Carapace is the result of a secret research project which integrated the HarJel self-repair system directly into the armor plates.

Armor Heavy Ferro|3069|0.0|21|Based upon the Light Ferro-Fibrous compound developed by Free Worlds League scientists, Durallex developed Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor for the Lyran Alliance Armed Forces in 3069. The result was a bulkier armor that was stronger. Uses 21 dynamic slots.|1000000.0
Angel ECM|3045|2.0|2|The Angel ECM Suite is an advanced version of the Guardian ECM Suite operating on a broader spectrum and greatly advances ECM technology on the battlefield. Development of the Angel began in the Draconis Combine shortly after the Battle of Luthien, but despite assistance from ComStar, cost overruns and internal problems within both powers kept it in its experimental stages for a long time and delayed its widespread deployment.|700000.0
Armor NSS|3045|0.0|7|The Null Signature System is another Capelan endeavour to recreate lost Star League ECM.
